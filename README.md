## Demether comes to revolutionize the agricultural market with sustainability, advanced technology, and circular economy through tokenization. â€¢ 

A **Demether**, **Robust** Foundry Projects.

## Farmers access our platform in a simplified manner using our own Account Abstraction, choosing to tokenize their crops, which are connected to various protocols, each with its specific function.

### Operation:

#### The farmer logs in socially and begins to enjoy all the benefits of the Account Abstraction without the need to pay for operations. Currently, we start with the tokenization of RWAs involving corn crops. But why would the farmer tokenize their crops? Their crop becomes a smart contract in the DN404 standard, which is divisible and efficient. 

#### The values are sent to the Aurora and Scroll networks, using them as proof of reserve, due to the efficiency and security of Scroll's ZK network and the carbon credit compensation of the Aurora network.

#### After tokenization, assets are made available on the platform to investors interested in the sustainable economy of tropical agriculture, providing great benefits to society and agriculture. These investors, holding fractions of the crop, enjoy various benefits in the market, in addition to the possibility of obtaining great returns.

#### The system uses Chainlink oracles linked to DN404; whenever the crop is valued, it is automatically updated with real-world data, adding more value for investors who believe in tropical sustainable agriculture.

#### The platform was designed with a focus on user experience, integrating, in addition to the Account Abstraction, the Ethereum Name Services (ENS), facilitating the purchase and transfer of assets.

#### In the next steps, the farmer will have their own wallet, together with the Account Abstraction, using the technology of Token Bonds Accounts to store the representative NFTs of their crops and all the credit acquired from the assets offered to the market. Thus, it will be able to convert all the value captured into applied science to the soils of its crops, contributing to a sustainable global economy and achieving significant results.

#### The final stage of our project is related to the security of the platform's clients, exploring vulnerabilities of smart contracts and addressing this challenge with OpenZeppelin's Ethernout.
